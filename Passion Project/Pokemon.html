        <p>
            Pokémon cards are part of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), a collectible card game based on the popular
            Pokémon franchise. Each card represents a Pokémon creature, trainer, or energy that players use to battle
            each other in turn-based matches. Cards typically include:
        <ul>
            <li>Name of the Pokémon</li>
            <li>Type (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass)</li>
            <li>Hit Points (HP)</li>
            <li>Moves or abilities</li>
            <li>Weaknesses/resistances</li>
            <li>Illustrations, which have become a popular part of the cards' appeal.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The TCG is played both casually and competitively, and many people also collect cards for their art, rarity,
            and value.
