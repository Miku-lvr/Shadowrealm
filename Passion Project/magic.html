            <p>
                Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is the first-ever trading card game, 
                combining fantasy, strategy, and deep lore. Players take on the role 
                of Planeswalkers, powerful spellcasters who summon creatures, cast spells,
                and use magical artifacts to reduce their opponent’s life total from 20 
                to 0.
